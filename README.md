# Hello-World
Hello world, coding is a beautiful thing, i truly believe that every human should learn to code, as we can work together to make the world a better place. I graduated from the University of Houston with a Bachelors in Computer information systems. This is my way of turning my dreams into reality, and becoming a better person everyday.
